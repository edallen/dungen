Things to do:

Relationships need work to add directionality.

Allow style dialog to restyle current map.

Add node restyling in node editor.

Add edge restyling in edge editor.

Magic effects for books

More staves

Connect hooks and oddities to the theme tagging system.

Add a random name generator and use it for NPCs and some monsters.

Flesh out the wilderness generator.

Monster customizer

Novel monster type generator

Add races to NPCs?

Add personal items and treasure to NPCs?

Give NPcs a goal and resident/visiting/raiding/passing through status?

Decouple magic item frequency from amount of treasure generated for node or have it replace some?

Should theme alter NPC class distribution?

Add notes re notice/reaction?

Add the concept of length to edges and a theme setting to bias for long or short distances. Short would have more door/archway/short hall type links.

Add level entrances as room features.


Refactor other dialogs to extract HTML to functions.


Map library and dungen derived stocker.
